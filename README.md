# HealthGPT

## **Inspiration**  
The inspiration behind HealthGPT came from the need to provide accessible, initial health guidance to users, especially in settings where immediate access to medical professionals may be limited. By combining AI-generated advice with real health professional input, HealthGPT aims to empower users to better understand their symptoms and seek appropriate care.

- Request a consultation with a healthcare provider when certain conditions are met.
- Doctor response to user consultation
- Order medication recommended by doctor using AI agent.
- *Coming soon*: Book appointments and enable 1:1 chat with health professionals.

## **How We Built It**
